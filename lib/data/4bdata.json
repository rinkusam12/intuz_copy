        "visualization": "Based on our research, we created a wireframe of the app and submitted it to the client. Team Intuz comprehensively explained to them the app’s workflow, including user features and navigation capabilities.",
        "designing": "Once the wireframe was signed off, our designers created several app design options that matched the original concept.  Client feedback was critical as it helped us redesign the basic app patterns with stunning elements.\n\nWhen the client selected the suitable one, we tried various color combinations to see which helped the app stand out the most. During this phase, we communicated with them consistently and kept them updated about the progress.",
        "development": "It was a critical task to build a customized home screen feed displaying articles. Moreover, we also built-in upvoting, live polling, co-authoring and commenting features.\n\nWe also incorporated a rewards-based program within the app which allows users to earn and redeem points for sharing their viewpoints and participating in forums and group discussions.\n\nThe client also wanted to give their users the freedom to make their profiles or groups public or private. The app also has robust security which keeps the messages exchanged between users and groups private and secure.",
        "satisfaction": "The developed app was thoroughly tested and reviewed post which it was deployed. The client was happy with the work delivered by Intuz, and continues to work with us for further app enhancements — including adding new features and improving the overall experience. 4b has since quickly become a fast-growing platform for bringing people with different perspectives and backgrounds together.",
